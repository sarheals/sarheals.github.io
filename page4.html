        <p>Shot on Iphone, Edited in adobe premiere, 2022</p> 
        
        <p>In my digital media class we were making short experimental films and I was just getting over COVID so I only had about 12 hours to film and edit. Inspired by the Twilight Zone, I tried to convey the uneasy feeling of being trapped in the same day over and over and over again. Which is what a lot of people were feeling during the time spent in quarantine. 
            I shot the film in my apartment with my IPhone7. My roommate starred and my cat co-starred. The score is completely original. I made noises on my electric guitar and used adobe premier to layer, and put parts of it in reverse.</p></div>

            <p> Six Shots of Espresso Later</p>
            <p> Paint on cardboard, Photoshop, 2022</p>
            <p> description 
                I started this piece when I was feeling down and decided to make a skull with bleeding eyes. The process was fun because I used a thin ink and let it drip down the side of the cardboard. I ended up adding colored paint as well. I thought it looked pretty cool but knew I could do better, so I took a photo and put it on photoshop. Here I created a multitude of iterations until reaching a point of satisfaction. The title was inspired by the people who come into the coffee shop I work at and order scary amounts of espresso.

                    One day I was walking on the street and I stumbled upon some fashion magazines. I immediately knew I would use them for a collage. I recently got into the punk rock scene and those aesthetics and I took inspiration from that. I am also influenced by the DADA artist, Hannah Hoch, who often made collages with people with exaggerated features. </p> </div>
