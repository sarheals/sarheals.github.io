        <p>Shot on Iphone, Edited in adobe premiere, 2022</p> 
        
        <p>Inspired by the Twilight Zone, I aimed to convey the uneasy feeling of being trapped in the same day over and over and over again. 
            I shot the film in my apartment with my IPhone7. I created the music using my electric guitar and editing on adobe Premiere.

            <p> Six Shots of Espresso Later</p>
            <p> Paint on cardboard, Photoshop, 2022</p>
            <p> 
                This piece featuring a skull with bleeding eyes was created when I felt down. The process let me express my emotions by experimenting with the ink falling down the page. Later, I took a photo of the painting and put it in Photoshop, where I manipulated it by playing with the layering. The title was inspired by the people who come into the coffee shop I work and order scary amounts of espresso.

                    One day I was walking on the street and I stumbled upon some fashion magazines. I immediately knew I would use them for a collage. I recently got into the punk rock scene and those aesthetics and I took inspiration from that. I am also influenced by the DADA artist, Hannah Hoch, who often made collages with people with exaggerated features. </p> </div>
