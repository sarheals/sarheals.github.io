                    This piece of work was created for a visual communications class at the University of San Francisco. The objective of the project was to create a public service announcement (PSA) poster. I decided to focus on how religion, specifically christianity, has played a huge role in the creation of our patriarchal society. I wanted my poster to speak to women who feel they do not have a voice in the shadows of the men in their lives. I want to empower women to fight back and stand up for their rights. 

                    I made this poster using photos from the web and photoshop. The face of the woman on the motorcycle is one of a woman on the cover of a vintage Playboy magazine. I specifically chose her because Playboy magazine over sexualises women on very extreme levels and have done so for the pleasure of men. Furthermore, the writing on the billboards are passages from the bible. Growing up in the midwest, I saw a lot of billboards like these while on road trips and they had a strong impact on me.

                    <p> The goal of this project was to create three icons representing a place in San Francisco. I decided to focus on Haight Ashbury. From the moment I first saw it when I visited San Francisco in 2018, I was in love. Later, I got a job at the Ben and Jerry’s ice cream shop right on the famous corner. This job allowed me to connect the folks who call the corner home. My three icons are based on people I met during my time at Ben and Jerrys as well as the drugs most greatly associated with Haight Ahsbury and its essence. . The first, Mushroom, told me that one time he got some sort of mushroom juice splashed in his eyes and if his eyes didn't move he would have grown mushrooms out of them, and this is why he is called mushroom. The second, Ruben, my manager at Ben and Jerry’s. He was a recovering alcoholic who had been homeless for five years. When I worked with him he was constantly high off weed and was very grateful to have that rather than alcohol. He taught me a lot about life. Finally, we have Marco who is a very unique individual, often tripping on acid and talking about the bible, hence the trippy eyes. Marco was also extremely intelligent and was constantly quoting philosophers and books. 

                        Overall, I have a strong connection to Haight Ashbury and this is sort of an ode to the people I've met.
