                    For this PSA poster, I  focused on how religion, specifically Christianity, has played a huge role in the creation of our patriarchal society. I think it is important to shed light on this because many people still base their lives on Christian teachings and ideals. 
                   I took existing images I found and manipulated them in photoshop. The woman is from the cover of a vintage Playboy magazine which I specifically chose because of Playboy’s infamous over-sexualization of women for the pleasure of men. Furthermore, the writing on the billboards is actual passages from the bible similar to the ones I saw on road trips as a kid.

                    <p> The goal of this project was to create three icons representing a place in San Francisco. I decided to focus on Haight Ashbury. From the moment I first saw it when I visited San Francisco in 2018, I was in love. Later, I got a job at the Ben and Jerry’s ice cream shop right on the famous corner. This job allowed me to connect the folks who call the corner home. My three icons are based on people I met during my time at Ben and Jerrys as well as the drugs most greatly associated with Haight Ahsbury and its essence. . The first, Mushroom, told me that one time he got some sort of mushroom juice splashed in his eyes and if his eyes didn't move he would have grown mushrooms out of them, and this is why he is called mushroom. The second, Ruben, my manager at Ben and Jerry’s. He was a recovering alcoholic who had been homeless for five years. When I worked with him he was constantly high off weed and was very grateful to have that rather than alcohol. He taught me a lot about life. Finally, we have Marco who is a very unique individual, often tripping on acid and talking about the bible, hence the trippy eyes. Marco was also extremely intelligent and was constantly quoting philosophers and books. 

                        Overall, I have a strong connection to Haight Ashbury and this is sort of an ode to the people I've met.
