               <p> “Betty Boot vs. Zombie Apocalypse” is an online game created using javascript, HTML and CSS code. The goal of the game is to help Betty Boop defeat the zombies and make it to safety. There is an underlying feminist message to the game. Betty is a bad ass zombie fighter rather than just the sex icon she was portrayed as in her cartoon. The game shows that a beautiful woman can be stronger and braver than she ever believed possible.. </p></div>

                <p>p5.js, Adobe Illustrator/ Photoshop, 2022</p> 
                
                <p>For this assignment we had to create an interactive website using javascript. It had to be based on a juxtaposition, and the one I chose was stasis and change. While brainstorming, I thought about a nightclub and how during the day it is completely still but at night it comes alive. I wanted to create my own nightclub, and decided to make it in space! The main goal of the project, however, was to create a place for users to escape into a different world. It was made in a hard time for myself and many others (covid) so I thought I’d have some fun with it. 

                    For the interactivities I used p5.js. I drew the aliens on adobe illustrator, and made the gifs on adobe photoshop.
