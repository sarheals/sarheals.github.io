        <p> 

            Sarah is a San Francisco based, Chicago born, multimedia artist and graphic designer.
            Creating is an essential part of her daily life. Taking inspiration from her daily life, as well as music, books and film, Sarah is able to express her internal world through her work. Throughout her time studying design at the University of San Francisco, she has developed a distinctive style.  During the isolation of the COVID Pandemic, she began creating art to express and reflect on her experiences. She has now done more than she ever could have imagined. In addition to her graphic design work, she has explored photography, collage, fashion, film, coding and music. To overcome a fear and achieve a major dream, Sarah sings, plays guitar, writes music and performs at open mics around the city. She loves connecting with other artists and musicians and continues to look for more points of inspiration in the vibrant society she calls home. 
                <p> isn't afraid to step out of her comfort zone â€” her work is courageous and original. She frequently uses art as a way to express her feelings about the impact of social constructs in society and doesnt give a fuck about making people uncomfortable. She is very aware she has the privilege of living in the bubble that is San Francisco and feels strongly about exploring the experiences of others existing in the world we live in.
