        About
    </div>
        <p> 

            I was born in the Northern suburbs of Chicago and moved to San Francisco for school. This move completely changed my outlook on life and I felt I was finally able to explore parts of myself I was previously afraid of. I got into art and music and began my BA in design. I quickly developed a unique style featuring saturated colors and feminist themes. Through my work, I am fighting against the ways I have been conditioned to be as a woman in society. I design because it is a powerful way to send messages and can convey more than language on its own. </p>
            <p>Graphic design is only one part of my creative lifestyle, however. Over the past year, I have overcome an extreme fear to achieve a major dream of mine, playing music for people. I now perform at open mics around the city on a weekly basis where I play guitar and sing songs I have written or covers of bands that greatly influence me. I am getting more and more used to being out of my comfort zone and feel it generating self-growth. 
            I am very grateful to have the opportunities and education provided for me by my single mother of five, shout out to Kristine, and plan to use my privileges for good.
